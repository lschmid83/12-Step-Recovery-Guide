# 12-Step Recovery

12-Step Recovery is an Android companion app for recoverymeetingfinder.com. When it is finished it aims to provide reading materials, daily quotes, reading material, motivational images, an in-person meeting map and motivational speaker tapes.

This repository contains the source code for the Android Studio Java project.

We are looking for contributors who want to help finish the app. The issue list outlines the features which still need work or have not been implemented yet.

Here are some screenshots of the app runnning in development mode:
